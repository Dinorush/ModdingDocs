Weapon Key Values
========================

This document provides a list of various Key Values utilized by weapons and their purposes.

Note that asset values are identical to strings in Key Value files.

These can be modified with KeyValue modding, see here: :doc:`weaponmodding`

The majority of these values are held in ``eWeaponVar``. Those that are can be modified with attachments (named "Mods" in Key Value files); otherwise, they cannot.
